## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration


To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).

  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use FLASK to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a Dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * query for the dates and temperature observations from a year from the last data point.
  * Return a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.
  
#### Data Analysis

* The following are optional challenge queries. These are highly recommended to attempt, but not required for the homework.

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

### Temperature Analysis II

* The starter notebook contains a function called `calc_temps` that will accept a start date and end date in the format `%Y-%m-%d` and return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01").


### Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.
